üçΩÔ∏è Foodie Finder - Berkeley Restaurant Recommendation System

Foodie Finder is an AI-powered restaurant recommendation system focused on Berkeley, CA. Built during the Pear + OpenAI Hackathon, this project of mine utilizes web scraping, sentiment analysis, and OpenAI‚Äôs APIs to offer personalized dining recommendations based on user preferences for ambiance, price, food quality, and service.
